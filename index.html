            <p>I was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. I grew up in
                Asgard
                under Odin's tutelage and trained in my footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, my stepmother
                Frigga
                and my adopted brother Loki are the only family I know, alongside my best friends Sif, Balder, and the
                Warriors Three.
