            <h5>Author:Jahid uddin</h5>
            <p>I was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. I grew up in
                Asgard
                under Odin's tutelage and trained in my footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, my stepmother
                Frigga
                and my adopted brother Loki are the only family I know, alongside my best friends Sif, Balder, and the
                Warriors Three.

            <p>I joined the Avengers under the guidance of S.H.I.E.L.D. and stood with them to stop the schemes of
                my own adopted brother, eventually following the newly formed team as they battled against Loki's army
